# My own achievements 🏆

- In 2020/21 I learned english from A1 to B1/B2 level
- In December 2021 I started to learn web development and I achieved it in 3 months by studying a lot, often from morning till evening

# A few words from me
A few years ago I was a gamer, often playing from morning till night and I was happy then. Well, "then", because when I turned the computer off, I wasn't happy. I was fat, closed to relationships with my peers, I was all by myself. I only had my computer and my friends on the servers. I was very worried about my future and one day I stepped on the scale and freaked out. Suddenly I felt such a kick to take action and I took action! I started to rollerblade 12 km every day and I started to learn English and soon C++, but I didn't succeed with C++ and that is good, because today I am in the best environment when it comes to technology 😉 Today I am a completely different person than when I was a gamer and today I want to be a good and well-liked person as well as a programmer 👨‍💻
#### I love self-development. I love work hard. I love computers! I love React ❤️
